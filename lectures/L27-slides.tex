\frametitle{Exam Coverage}

The exam is based on material we have covered in the lectures \& labs.

The exam is cumulative: covers from the first lecture to the last.

Lab material you are expected to know covers all projects.

\frametitle{How to Prepare}

How to prepare for the final exam:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Review lecture notes, slides, and videos.
	\item Understand your lab solutions.
	\item Try old exams.
	\item Ask questions in Piazza if you need.
\end{enumerate}

\frametitle{Exam Logistics}

The exam will take place according to the registrar's office schedule.

We'll have an alternate plan if the exam has to be online:\\
\quad This would be a take-home exam with a 24h window.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Exam Layout}

The exam will be majority written questions, but have some programming questions.

It should resemble the midterm exam in some ways.

The programming questions will resemble the labs and in-class exercises.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Exam Logistics}
There will be no questions allowed during the exam.

If in-person, it's a closed book exam, non-programmable calculators allowed.

If online: you are expected to do the exam completely independently...\\
\quad Treat it like a final exam.
