\lecture{ 2 --- Review of Processes, Threads, Hardware }{\term}{Jeff Zarnett}

\section*{Past is Prologue}
In prerequisite courses (should you have taken them as per the standard program!), we covered three important things that are relevant to the operating system: processes, threads, and hardware. Here, we're going to take some time to review these things and make sure we're on solid ground before moving on. 


\subsection*{About Hardware}
I know that the prerequisite courses have covered things around the basic structure of the computer, things like the relationship of the CPU, bus, main memory... So we certainly do not need to repeat that repetition, but some things that were ``new'' in the concurrency discussion are relevant here.

\paragraph{Interrupts and Disabling Them.}


\paragraph{Test-and-Set and Atomic Types}

\subsection*{The Process and the Thread}
